TODO:
	1. Make up to 12 levels - ENDING IT AT 10
	2. Make a Main Menu - DONE
	3. Update levels with new wall sprites - NOT HAPPENING
	4. An Ending
	
Feedback from playtesters:
	1. Need a tutorial level showing that you can throw buckets through same coloured blocks/walls.
	2. Need to fix a bug where Players walk in to climbing wall, change it's colour, then is_on_wall isn't updated so they have to exit body to reset it.
	3. Need to fix a bug where the paint bucket can hit two things at once (Player and Platform happened at once).
	4. Need to add an icon for what colour of paint you're currently holding.
	5. Need to be able to right click to stop throwing paint bucket.
